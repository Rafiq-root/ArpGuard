> **ArpGuard** is a lightweight, stealthy Python script that detects ARP Spoofing attacks in real-time. It acts as a "Blue Team" tool, alerting you instantly if a hacker attempts a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on your local network.

## 🚀 Features
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auto-Gateway Detection** | Automatically finds your Router IP and MAC address. |
| **Stealth Mode** | Uses passive sniffing; does not broadcast packets unless necessary. |
| **Instant Alerts** | Prints a warning the millisecond a spoofed packet is detected. |
| **Low Resource Usage** | Optimized with BPF filters to run on low-end hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi). |

## 📦 Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Rafiq-root/ArpGuard.git](https://github.com/Rafiq-root/ArpGuard.git)
cd ArpGuard


2. Install Dependencies You need Python 3 and Scapy.
Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-scapy


🛠️ Usage
This tool requires root privileges to access the network card.

Basic Run:

Bash
sudo python3 arpguard.py

What to Expect:

The script will print the Gateway's MAC address.

It will sit silently until an attack occurs.

If an attack is detected, you will see:

[!!!] YOU ARE UNDER ATTACK! Real MAC: XX:XX... Fake MAC: YY:YY...

🧠 How It Works
ArpGuard uses the Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU) principle:

Baseline: On startup, it asks the router for its real MAC address.

Monitor: It listens to all ARP traffic using Scapy.

Compare: Every time a packet claims to be the router, it compares the MAC address to the baseline.

Alert: If they don't match, it triggers an alarm.
